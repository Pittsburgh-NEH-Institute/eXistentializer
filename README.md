## Overview

The eXist-db App Initializer is a lightweight bash shell script that creates the housekeeping files needed to build and install an eXist-db package into an instance of the database. The initializer reads a *properties.txt* file that you customize for your project and it uses the information there to create the following files:

* *repo.xml*
* *build.xml*
* *expath-pkg.xml*
* *pre-install.xq*

The initializer also creates an *.exist.json* file that supports synchronizing development inside VSCode with a running instance of eXist-db. This synchronization assumes that you are running eXist-db on your local machine on port 8080 and that the *admin* password is null. If you are not using VSCode, you can either edit *initializer.sh* to remove the code that creates *.exist.json* or just delete that file after it is created.

The Initializer prioritizes light weight and ease of use, which means that it creates the three files that required for building and installing an *xar* package file but it does not attempt to create all content that users might want in a project repo. For example, the Initializer does not attempt to configure eXist-db users and permissions, GitHub continuous integration (CI), or Docker. Users who require that additional functionality will find it in Duncan Patersonâ€™s [generator-exist](https://github.com/eXist-db/generator-exist) project.

## Getting started
This script relies on two files to configure the basic app housekeeping files required by eXist-db. These files are called `properties.txt` and `initializer.sh`. To run the script and build the application for installation in eXist-db, users require the following software.

### Dependencies
- bash shell
    - Mac and Linux users: use the Terminal or Bash shell already on your computer, or your preferred shell
    - Windows users: use [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Git
- `ant` is required to build and install eXist-db applications
    - [Mac Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ant) users may use `brew install ant` at command line
    - Linux users don't need my instructions here
    - [Windows Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ant) users may use `choco install ant` at Git bash shell command line

### Instructions (draft, please do not attempt)

1. Download the `repo name` and save to the directory on your computer where you plan to create the eXist-db application.
2. Open `properties.txt` with your favorite text editor. Edit the configuration properties according to your requirements and save.
    2a. Specify the target directory you where you plan to develop the application.
3. At the command line, navigate to the `initializer` directory and run `./initializer.sh`.
4. (optional) Using Git and GitHub
    - At the command line, navigate to the target directory and run `git init` to initialize Git.
    - In GitHub, create a new *empty* repository with the same name as your target directory. Do not add a description, README, .gitignore, or license.
    - Once you have created the empty repository, follow the instructions under "...or push an existing repository from the command line."

## Development patterns
- run ant (add links?)
- install in eXist-db using package manager
- start syncing in VSCode (optional)
